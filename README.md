# Virtual_assistant_vector
It is a virtual assistant named 'Vector' although it is hardcoded

Vector do some specific tasks like:
1: Google Automation
2: Youtube Automation
3: Email Automationn
4: Wikipedia Automation
5: Wishing you (This is the most important part of Vector and I am kidding you right now)
6: Email Automation (Hard Coded)

Note: I am working on real AI part of this project. You will find that project in this github only. And I am not kidding you this time (ðŸ˜‚)
